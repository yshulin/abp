[ABP](https://abp.io/) offers an **opinionated architecture** to build enterprise software solutions with **best practices** on top of the **.NET** and the **ASP.NET Core** platforms. It provides the fundamental infrastructure, production-ready startup templates, pre-built application modules, UI themes, tooling, guides and documentation to implement that architecture properly and **automate the details** and repetitive works as much as possible.

## What ABP Provides?

ABP bridges the gap between ASP.NET Core and real-world business application requirements, and makes you focus on your own business code.

The following diagram contains the core components of the **ABP Platform** and shows how ABP sits between **ASP.NET Core** and **Your Application**:
