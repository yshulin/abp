ABP Suite requires an ABP solution to work on, that's why when you start it, you need an ABP Solution and it should be added in ABP Suite UI.

## Add an existing solution

Add your existing solution which was created from the [ABP Studio](../studio/index.md) or [ABP CLI](../cli/index.md). You have to enter your `YourProject.sln` file path. Also, it works if you enter the directory of the `YourProject.sln` when there's single solution inside.
