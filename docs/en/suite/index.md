ABP Suite is a complementary tool to the ABP Platform. ABP Suite allows you to build web pages in a matter of minutes. 

It's a .NET Core Global tool that can be installed from the command line. If you are using [ABP Studio](../studio/index.md), you don't even need to install it because it should already be installed, when you first installed the [ABP Studio](../studio/index.md).

By using the ABP Suite, you can create a new ABP solution, generate CRUD pages from the database to the front-end and directly get a kickstart for your application. ABP Suite is actively developed and new features are being added version by version according to roadmap and your feedbacks.
