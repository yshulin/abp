# The new ABP Platform is live!

We're thrilled to announce that the **new ABP.IO Platform is now live!** Our team has been hard at unifying and enhancing the entire platform to deliver a seamless, user-friendly experience. Here's what's new:


### Unified domain and enhanced navigation 🌍
All our services are now consolidated under a single domain; [abp.io](https://abp.io). This means you no longer need to navigate through multiple subdomains. The new mega menu makes finding what you need easier and faster.


### Modern design and improved UX 🎨
The platform boasts a fresh, modern design aimed at improving both aesthetics and functionality. This redesign enhances usability, making your interaction with ABP.IO more intuitive.



### Documentation in one place 📃
We’ve combined the ABP (open-source) and ABP Commercial (paid) documents into a single, comprehensive resource. This unified documentation will help you find what you're looking for more efficiently. The new documentation address is [abp.io/docs](https://abp.io/docs).  When you switch to old ABP versions before v8.3, you will see the old documents are still available. 



### Introducing "ABP Studio Community Edition" 🪄
We're excited to introduce the **ABP Studio Community Edition**, which is now **available for free**. This edition provides powerful tools to streamline your development process. You can easily create a new project with a configuration wizard in ABP Studio. It also provides module management, which means you can add/remove an ABP Module easily. You can also debug your microservice project and track the HTTP requests easily. Connecting your local development environment to a local or remote Kubernetes cluster is another cool feature of ABP Studio. We aim for ABP Studio to be the primary tool for ABP developers to manage their projects.

> Download ABP Studio 👉 [abp.io/studio](https://abp.io/studio). 


### Enhanced "ABP CLI" 🚀
ABP CLI is also renewed. The new CLI is compatible with ABP Studio. It adds new commands. The new CLI is now available on NuGet at [nuget.org/packages/Volo.Abp.Studio.Cli](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Volo.Abp.Studio.Cli). It's a dotnet global tool. When you install ABP Studio, the new ABP CLI is automatically installed.  You can still use the old ABP CLI commands. To use the legacy ABP CLI commands just add `--old` parameter to your commands.
