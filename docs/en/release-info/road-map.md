## Backlog Items

The *Next Versions* section above shows the main focus of the planned versions. However, in each release, we add new features to the ABP platform.

### Framework

The ABP framework is [open source](https://github.com/abpframework/abp) and free for everyone. You can see its [public backlog](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/milestone/2). Here, are some of the important features you can expect from next versions:

* [#236](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/236) / Resource based authorization system
* [#2882](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/2882) / Providing a gRPC integration infrastructure (while it is [already possible](https://github.com/abpframework/abp-samples/tree/master/GrpcDemo) to create or consume gRPC endpoints for your application, we plan to create endpoints for the [standard application modules](../modules/index.md))
* [#57](https://github.com/abpframework/abp/issues/57) / Built-in CQRS infrastructure

### Application Modules / UI Themes

ABP Platform provides many (free and commercial) [pre-built application modules](../modules/index.md) and modern [UI themes](../ui-themes/index.md). In every release, many enhancements and bugfixes are already done on the existing modules. In addition, here some of the planned features for next versions:

* LeptonX theme: New layouts, styles and components
* CMS Kit module: Meta information for SEO, media gallery, RSS feed, content versioning, social media streams
* Identity module: Idle session warning
* Payment module: Invoice system
* New module: User notification
* New module: Dynamic dashboard
* New module: User guiding
* New module: Keycloak integration

### ABP Studio

[ABP Studio](../studio/index.md) is a cross-platform desktop application for ABP and .NET developers to simplify and automate daily tasks of developers. It has a community (free) edition as well as commercial editions. It is released and versioned independently from the ABP platform and frequently released.

Here, are some of the important planned features for next ABP Studio versions:

* Theme builder for the LeptonX theme
* Analyze user solutions to explore entities, domain services, application services, pages and other fundamental objects.
* Add status bar to the built-in browser to easily see errors
* Swagger authentication support for the built-in browser
* Show related requests/events (traces) together in the solution runner panel
* Integrate common tool dashboards into ABP Studio (such a Garana, Redis, RabbitMQ, Kibana, etc)
* Built-in command terminal
* Automate all steps of new service creation for microservice solutions
* Container application type support for Solution Runner (to individually control docker dependencies)
* More options while creating new solutions
* Downloading samples in ABP studio
* Built-in ABP documentation experience
* Auto-execute terminal commands in markdown files
* Compare changed on the startup templates when a new ABP version is published
* Remove unused projects while downloading source code of an existing module
* Testing/hosting applications for module templates
* Easily explore all module and package dependencies of a large solution
* Built-in deployment options
* Rapid application development features
* ABP support integration

### ABP Suite

[ABP Suite](../suite/index.md) is a GUI application that is mainly used to generate CRUD style pages in your application. You define your entity and it can generate all the code from the database layer to the UI layer. The generated code is clean and a perfect starting point to implement your custom requirements on top of it.

Here, are some of the important planned features for next ABP Suite versions:

* Handle image properties for entities
* Allow to define extra properties for DTOs those are not a part of the entity
* Allow to create pages instead of modals for CRUD page generation
* View-only (detail view) modal/page for an entity
* Export child/detail entity records as a part of export operation for a main (master) entity
* Allow to accept attachments (files) for an entity
* Allow to add custom entity actions for an entity
* Allow to inherit from an existing entity class
* Custom form layouts on CRUD page generation
