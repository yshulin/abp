# The Official Themes
ABP provides a complete UI theming system. While you can build your own themes, you can directly use the following pre-built themes in your applications.

## The LeptonX Theme

[LeptonX Theme](https://x.leptontheme.com/) is the official and default theme when you create a new ABP solution. A screenshot from the LeptonX theme:

LeptonX theme has two versions:

* [LeptonX Theme](lepton-x/index.md) is included in commercial licenses.
* [LeptonX Lite Theme](lepton-x-lite/index.md) is provided as free.

## The Basic Theme

The Basic Theme is a minimalist theme that doesn't add any styling on top of the plain [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styles. You can take the Basic Theme as the base theme and build your own theme or styling on top of it. Here, a screenshot from the theme:
